Yet, Trump made three major mistakes in the Singapore summit: accepting a vague, poorly-crafted summit statement that was weaker than predecessor agreements; unilaterally canceling allied military exercises without reciprocal North Korean action; and exuberantly praising Kim Jong-un despite the North Korean leader being on the U.S. sanctions lists for crimes against humanity.\nTrump’s claims of North Korean denuclearization failed to materialize. North Korea has not only not taken any steps to denuclearize but instead continues to nuclearize with new production capabilities to do so at an accelerated rate. All of the administration’s “successes” were achieved in greater numbers by previous administrations with less hype.\nWhile there is always a chance of a surprise breakthrough in a second summit, recent North Korean public statements indicate the two sides are no closer to even having a common definition of denuclearization let alone a comprehensive detailed agreement.\nIn light of Trump’s unilateral concessions in Singapore and negative views of alliances, there are several concerns surrounding what he might do in the next summit. Trump could sign a peace declaration which would be a meaningless feel-good gesture that has no tangible benefits but could have serious negative consequences for the decades-old South Korean-U.S. alliance defense security. He may also be tempted to sign an “ICBM only deal” which purports to eliminate one threat but raising South Korean and Japanese fears of a decoupling of the alliances.\nFinally, Trump might reduce U.S. forces in South Korea prior to reducing the North Korean conventional threat.
